# Sharing
Simple Angular/PHP apps that I use to download images and movies that I upload from my phone.

# What is this
A small API (get only) endpoint that returns a list of files. A small angular application that retrieves the list and creates hyperlinks for each.

# How it works for me

I installed an application called AndFTP on my phone.  I use AndFTP to upload pictures and movies to a server.  Once the file is uploaded I tell whoever I am sharing the file with (usually my wife) that it is ready. Then she goes to the page and right clicks on it to download.  Then I use FTP to delete the file.

# Why

I needed to share a 230M movie file of my son proposing to his fiance with my wife.  We tried using Google Drive, blue tooth, and both tooks hours and never succeeded. I finally installed AndFTP on my phone and after I configured it the file took less than two minutes to upload.  I have no idea why those other technologies were so slow, but sometimes you have to go old school.
